#  TrafficEye: Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System  

##  Overview  
TrafficEye is a real-time traffic monitoring system that detects and tracks vehicles using OpenCV and dynamically controls a simulated traffic light based on vehicle density. This project aims to improve traffic management using computer vision techniques.  

##  Features  
-  **Vehicle Detection & Tracking** â€“ Uses background subtraction and contour detection to identify moving objects.  
-  **Traffic Density Monitoring** â€“ Tracks the number of vehicles in a region of interest (ROI).  
-  **Smart Traffic Light Control** â€“ Changes the traffic signal dynamically based on vehicle count.  
-  **Real-Time Processing** â€“ Efficiently processes video streams for accurate traffic monitoring.
